# Guess-the-TV-show-name

## About The Project && Dependencies

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

This Project was written in Typescript.

Project uses, React and MATERIAL-UI.

## Gameplay and rules:

The goal of the game is to guess a TV show's name.

The player will see a placeholder for a TV name with some missing letters. 

The player should guess and fill in the TV show's name. 

If the player guesses successfully a tv show name, it gets a point and moves forward to guess another tv show name.

In any time the player would be able to use a hint feature in case it's stuck with a specific TV show.

The player has a total of 3 life points. For each wrong guess, it loses a point.

If the player lost all 3 points the game is over and can be started again.

The player would be able to view a statistics popup (the data needs to be saved for the session).
